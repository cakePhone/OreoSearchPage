## Installation
### Firefox
Click the menu icon on the top right corner of Firefox, go to Settings, Home. Alternatively you can paste about:preferences#home in your URL bar.

Next to "New Windows and Tabs" select "Custom URLs.." on the dropdown menu for "Homepage and new windows". An input field will appear and you can paste https://cakephone.github.io/OreoSearchPage/ in there.

Next you'll need to install [New Tab Override](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override) and if a new tab doesn't open upon installing it, make one. The new tab will be the Add-On's settings page, by default it's set to custom URL so all you need to do is paste https://cakephone.github.io/OreoSearchPage/ in the URL field.

All done! Enjoy the search page!
